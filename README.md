# AG-Root-of-a-Function
Project of a class on Genetic Algorithms
This is a project of a class called "Sistemas evolutivos aplicados a robótica" ministered by Prof. Dr. Eduardo do Valle Simões in the second semester of 2020 in University of São Paulo (USP). This program uses a genetic algorithm to find a root of a given function (or the value closer to 0 in case it doesn't exists).
